In this document, to allow satellite communications on spectrum previously allocated only to terrestrial services, the Commission modifies the United States Table of Frequency Allocations to authorize bi- directional, secondary mobile-satellite service operations in certain spectrum bands that have no primary, non-flexible-use legacy incumbents, Federal or non-Federal. For these bands, we authorize SCS only where one or more terrestrial licensees--together holding all licenses on the relevant channel throughout a defined geographically independent area--lease access to their spectrum rights to a participating satellite operator, whose license reflects these frequencies and the geographically independent area in which they will offer SCS. In recognition that this new offering has the potential to bring life-saving connectivity to remote areas, the Commission also applies interim 911 call and text routing requirements to ensure that help is available to those who need it today while we work toward enabling automatic location-based routing of all emergency communications whether or not there is a terrestrial connection available.","['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Communications', 'Communications common carriers', 'Communications equipment', 'Radio', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Satellites', 'Telecommunications']",2024-05-30,[],[],Tie/No match - Likely does not require a compliance guide,"['Wholesale Trade', 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services', 'Information', 'Other Services (except Public Administration)', 'Administrative and Support and Waste Services', 'Manufacturing', 'Public Administration', 'Transportation and Warehousing', 'Construction', 'Retail Trade', 'Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation', 'Real Estate Rental and Leasing']",['Manufacturing'],the United States,FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION,

The 2018 AHP Rule was a significant departure from the Department's longstanding pre-rule guidance on the definition of ""employer"" under ERISA. This departure substantially weakened the Department's traditional criteria in a manner that would have enabled the creation of commercial AHPs functioning effectively as health insurance issuers.

This action is consistent with the State Department's addition of Nicaragua to the list of countries that are subject to a U.S. arms embargo under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). To reflect this changed status under the ITAR, BIS adds Nicaragua to Country Group D:5. BIS's amendments also address concerns regarding the Nicaraguan Government's commission of human rights abuses against citizens and civil society groups, as well as the regime's ongoing military and security cooperation with Russia. Specifically, BIS is moving Nicaragua from Country Group B to Country Group D, a more restrictive country grouping, applying a stringent licensing policy for items controlled for national security reasons, and making the country subject to `military end use' and `military end user' restrictions. This rule advances the U.S. Government's efforts to restrict the availability of items subject to the EAR to Nicaragua's military and security services. Additionally, consistent with BIS's authorities under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, this rule demonstrates a commitment to using export controls to protect human rights and promote democracy.","['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Exports', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Terrorism']",2024-03-15,[],[],Tie/No match - Likely does not require a compliance guide,[],,Nicaragua,DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE,Bureau of Industry and Security

This document is a summary of the Commission's Report and Order. The Report and Order adopted rules to more precisely route wireless 911 calls and Real-Time Texts (RTT) to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), which can result in faster response times during emergencies. Wireless 911 calls have historically been routed to PSAPs based on the location of the cell tower that handles the call. Sometimes, however, the 911 call is routed to the wrong PSAP because the cell tower is not in the same jurisdiction as the 911 caller. This can happen, for instance, when an emergency call is placed near a county border. These misrouted 911 calls must be transferred from one PSAP to another, which consumes time and resources and can cause confusion and delay in emergency response. The Report and Order requires wireless providers to deploy technology that supports location-based routing, a method that relies on precise information about the location of the wireless caller's device, on their internet Protocol (IP)-based networks and to use location-based routing to route 911 voice calls and RTT communications to 911 originating on those networks when caller location is accurate and timely. The Report and Order provides six months for nationwide wireless providers to implement location-based routing for wireless 911 voice calls and provides 24 months for non-nationwide wireless providers to implement location-based routing of wireless 911 voice calls. The Report and Order provides 24 months for all wireless providers to implement location-based routing for RTT communications to 911.","['Communications', 'Communications common carriers', 'Communications equipment', 'Internet', 'Radio', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Satellites', 'Security measures', 'Telecommunications', 'Telephone']",2024-05-13,[],[],Tie/No match - Likely does not require a compliance guide,"['Wholesale Trade', 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services', 'Health Care and Social Assistance', 'Information', 'Other Services (except Public Administration)', 'Administrative and Support and Waste Services', 'Manufacturing', 'Public Administration', 'Transportation and Warehousing', 'Construction', 'Retail Trade', 'Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation', 'Real Estate Rental and Leasing']",['Manufacturing'],all states,FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION,

Substantial observational evidence has documented the consistent presence of right whales within the MRA Wedge from February through April and aerial surveys have similarly documented the presence of aggregated fixed gear in the MRA Wedge during this same time period. Due to the co-occurrence of whales and buoy lines, both in high densities in this area during the specified times of year, this entanglement risk is expected to recur annually.

Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for ""higher-risk mortgages,"" termed ""higher-priced mortgage loans"" or ""HPMLs"" in the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) jointly issued final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014. The Agencies' rules exempted, among other loan types, transactions of $25,000 or less, and required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. Additionally, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted because the CPI-W decreased, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the CPI-W in effect as of June 1, 2023, the exemption threshold will increase from $31,000 to $32,400, effective January 1, 2024.","['Accounting', 'Advertising', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Consumer protection', 'Credit', 'Credit unions', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Mortgages', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations', 'Truth in lending', 'Truth-in-lending']",2024-01-01,[],[],Tie/No match - Likely does not require a compliance guide,"['Finance and Insurance', 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services', 'Information', 'Other Services (except Public Administration)', 'Administrative and Support and Waste Services', 'Manufacturing', 'Public Administration', 'Wholesale Trade', 'Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation']","['Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services']",all states,DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,"Office of the Comptroller of the Currency', 'FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM', 'Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"
